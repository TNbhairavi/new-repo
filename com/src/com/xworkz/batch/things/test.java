where javac is a compiler source code is convered into byte code                                           java and javac                      dont   limitations of array

JVM is a java virtual machine in this source code is complied and covered into byte code
JRE is a java runtime envirnment in this with the set of tools program is excuted




4.class is a over collections of data and objects(real world entity)
object  is a instance of class, it contains all the property of class                                              class,object,signature of class


5..java file is a source code file written by developer                                                            java and class file
.class file is a byte code file where complier convert source in byte code




7.java is high level object oriented progremming lang                                                                 java


12.their are two types of data type                                                                                       datatypes
primitive 
non primitive 
in primitive their are 8 primitives
int,float,char,long,short,double,boolen
int non primitives are in n number  some of examples are array,string, class etc


10.keywords
if,return,for,long,short,else,break,int,float,char,boolen,do,do while,while,else if                                       keywords



9.variables are used top intilize and to declare the values                                                                variables and types
static and non static are used to intilize





14.featurs
